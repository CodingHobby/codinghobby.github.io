This website was conceived as a crossover between a tech blog and a tutorial website.
It is not meant to be a place where I can just ramble about JavaScript frameworks, but actually give some helpful information about them, as well.

The main series of article I am writing at the moment is called [Hello World](https://codinghobby.github.io/helloworld/2017/03/23/hello-world-1.html), where I start from the very basics of JavaScript to get to more advanced stuff. 

Thanks to another contributor, Dylan LaCoursiere, there is also an [article](https://codinghobby.github.io/history/2017/03/25/js-history.html) on the history of the JavaScript language.

I also wrote an article on using [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com), which is the technology I used to make this site!
