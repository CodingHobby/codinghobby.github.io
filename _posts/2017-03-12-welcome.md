This website was conceived as a crossover between a tech blog and a tutorial website.
It is not meant to be a place where I can just ramble about JavaScript frameworks, but actually give some helpful information about them, as well.

As I already said in the ```about``` section, this website uses Jekyll to generate a static website.

This is also going to be the argoument of the first article I'll be posting (hopefully coming soon).
